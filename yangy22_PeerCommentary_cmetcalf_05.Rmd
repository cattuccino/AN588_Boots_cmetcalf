# Boots for Days!

## Question 1

Using the “KamilarAndCooperData.csv” dataset, run a linear regression looking at log(HomeRange_km2) in relation to log(Body_mass_female_mean) and report your β coeffiecients (slope and intercept).

```{r}
library(curl)

f <- curl("https://raw.githubusercontent.com/fuzzyatelin/fuzzyatelin.github.io/master/AN588_Fall23/KamilarAndCooperData.csv")
d <- read.csv(f, header = TRUE, sep = ",", stringsAsFactors = FALSE)
head(d) #the dataframe we are using
```

```{r}
m1 <- lm(data = d, log(HomeRange_km2) ~ log(Body_mass_female_mean)) #takes the linear model of the logged data
summary(m1) #allows us to see the data associated, aka the slope and intercept
#'* EY: Also see the Std.Error from whole dataset here. *
```
Slope: 1.03643 
Intercept: -9.44123

Confidence interval for data:
```{r}
ci <- confint(m1, level = 0.95)
ci
```

EY: I did the same thing as you for question one. Good job!


## Question 2

Then, use bootstrapping to sample from your data 1000 times with replacement, each time fitting the same model and calculating the same coefficients. This generates a sampling distribution for each β coefficient.

Estimate the standard error for each of your β coefficients as the standard deviation of the sampling distribution from your bootstrap and determine the 95% CI for each of your β coefficients based on the appropriate quantiles from your sampling distribution.

How does the former compare to the SE estimated from your entire dataset using the formula for standard error implemented in lm()?

How does the latter compare to the 95% CI estimated from your entire dataset?

```{r}
library(boot) #package that allows us to bootstrap with a function
statistic <- function(formula, data, indices) {
  d <- data[indices,] #sample selection
  fit <- lm(formula, data=d) #regression model
  return(coef(fit)) #tells it that we want coefficients to be estimated
}
set.seed(22) #'* Why set seed? *
sample <- boot(data = d, statistic = statistic, R = 1000, formula = log(HomeRange_km2) ~ log(Body_mass_female_mean)) #boot function, sampling 1000 times with the linear regression model and applying the y ~ x function from above
summary(sample) #outputs our sample data

sample #'* EY: Instead of doing summary sample you should just call sample and it will give you the bootstrap statistics. This is also where you would find the standard error of bootstrapping*

#standard error of samples?
boot.ci(sample, type = "perc", index = 1) #CI of intercept
boot.ci(sample, type = "perc", index = 2) #CI of BMFM

#'* EY: What made you chose to use type = perc? I chose norm but I didn't actually check that the distribution was normal so I will definitely go back and check if there is a better CI to use.*
```
Both CIs of the sample and original data are very similar to each other. 
*I could not get the method we had done in the modules to work below so I found a different solution on https://www.statmethods.net/advstats/bootstrapping.html which I used above, but I am not sure how to calculate the standard error using sd?

EY: You actually have all of the pieces you need already and I don't think the next two chunks are necessary. Great job! 
```{r}
k <- 1000 #number of samples
n <- 30 #size of each sample
s <- NULL #holds each sample
for (i in 1:k) {
  s[[i]] <- sample(d, size=n, replace = TRUE)
}
head(s) #gives our samples

```

```{r}
m <- NULL #holds each model and calculation
for (i in 1:k) {
  m[[i]] <- lm(data=d, log(Body_mass_female_mean) ~ log(HomeRange_km2)) #calculated model from question 1
}
head (m) # how do I make this apply to the sample, I only get errors when trying to apply it using s[[i]] as data?
```


se <- NULL #holds each estimated standard error
for (i in 1:k) {
  se[i] <- sd(s[[i]]) #calculates standard error with standard deviation of the sampling distribution
}
head(se)

Calculating standard error with the sd() of the sampling distribution is also only giving an error? (had to remove so I could knit)
